##FIRST STEPS

I defined a problem in order to understand the insights required and the relevant data understanding required.
After problem definition, there is the Data Loading step where the excel file is read into the jupyter notebook for further analysis.
The next step is the data preprocessing. The main aim of this step is to ensure data is clean by checking for data quality aspects.
I removed outliers and duplicates in the dataset.
The final step was to extract the new and cleaned dataset and move on to the next stages of the analysis.


##SECOND STEPS

Data splitting,model building. model fitting or train,making predictions and Evaluation by use of metrics are the actions I took on the Step Two Machine Learning Project.
I used RandomForest Classifier algorithm.
